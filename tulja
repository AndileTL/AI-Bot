I want to build a professional, modern, and responsive web application for an educational and social welfare NGO. The website should focus on four main pillars: Education, Women & Girl Child Welfare, Environmental Activities, and Health Initiatives. It should be visually appealing with a blue gradient color scheme and a white background to match the blue-colored logo. Please generate the complete source code (HTML/CSS/JavaScript + backend in Node.js or PHP or Firebase), structured content, and all UI elements based on the following detailed requirements:
